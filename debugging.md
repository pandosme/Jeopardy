I have developed a wep application of jeopardy.
There are a number of clients connected to this game including gameboard (laptop connected to a TV), players (mobile phones) and gamemaster (phone)

This is the directory structure of the application
.
├── app.js
├── config
│	└── config.json
├── model
│	└── Question.js
├── node_modules
├── public
│	├── css
│	│	└── styles.css
│	├── js
│	│	├── admin.js
│	│	├── gameboard.js
│	│	├── game.js
│	│	├── gamemaster.js
│	│	├── player.js
│	│	└── upload.js
│	├── gameboard.html
│	├── game.html
│	├── gamemaster.html
│	├── player.html
│	└── upload.html
└── routes
	├── api.js
	└── pages.js

There are bugs that need to be fixed I have changes I want to make.  You can ask for any of the files to review when I request a change.  I will supply 4 files to review to get a better understanding.
Look at these files and respond OK if you understand how the game is structured.
